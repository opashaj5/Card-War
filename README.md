# Card War!
---
## Concept:

The game of War is a fun and simple card game. It's player vs. the computer. The goal is to be the first to win all 52 cards. The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards. Each players stack of cards is faced down. The players flip a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and adds to their stack. The game ends when one player has won all the cards.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Challenges

The CSS portion was the most challenging in this project. I had a vision of what I wanted my project to look like but not being too familiar with all the CSS properties, it took a lot of trial and error to get it close to how I envisioned it.
