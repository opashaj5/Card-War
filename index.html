            <p>The game of War is a fun and simple card game. It's you vs. the computer. The goal is to be the first to win all 52 cards. The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards. Each players stack of cards is faced down. The players flip a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and adds to their stack. The game ends when one player has won all the cards.</p>
